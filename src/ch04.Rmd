**4E1.** In the model definition below, which line is the likelihood?

$$y_i ∼ Normal(μ, σ)$$
$$μ ∼ Normal(0, 10)$$

$$σ ∼ Uniform(0, 10)$$
$y_i ∼Normal(\mu, \sigma)$ is the likelihood.

**4E2.** In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?

There are two paramaters in the posterior distribution: $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

**4E3.** Using the model definition above, write down the appropriate form of Bayes’ theorem that
includes the proper likelihood and priors.

$$p(\mu,\sigma|y) = \frac{N(y|\mu,\sigma)N(\mu|0, 10)Unif(\sigma|0,10)}{\int\int\ N(y|\mu,\sigma)N(\mu|0, 10)Unif(\sigma|0,10)d\mu d\sigma}$$

**4E4.** In the model definition below, which line is the linear model?
$$y_i ∼ Normal(μ, σ)$$
$$μ_i = α + βx_i$$
$$ α ∼ Normal(0, 10)$$
$$β ∼ Normal(0, 1)$$
$$σ ∼ Uniform(0, 10)$$
Answer: $μ_i = α + βx_i$

**4E5.** In the model definition just above, how many parameters are in the posterior distribution?

Three: $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\sigma$
